## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
**CompLex** is the first **automatically constructed music theory lexicon** designed to enhance text-to-music generation.  
Instead of relying solely on scarce and noisy music data, we let **LLMs educate LMMs** by injecting structured knowledge of music theory.  

Our contributions:  
- **CompLex**: A large-scale music theory lexicon with **37,432 items** across 9 categories and 90 properties.  
- **LexConstructor**: A novel multi-agent algorithm with **role-playing + QA strategy** to construct expert-level lexicons from just 9 keywords and 5 prompt templates.  
- **Applications**: Integrating CompLex into text-to-music models significantly improves **mood accuracy, genre accuracy, relevance, and overall music quality**.
